This is my Personal Portfolio Website which I've designed with HTML and CSS. It does not have functionality or connectivity yet as it's just a layout.
I've not added Tailwind/JavaScript
Semantic HTML (nav, section, main, header, footer, progress, a, p, div, button)
CSS(flex, grid, animation, transition, media query, box-shadow)
